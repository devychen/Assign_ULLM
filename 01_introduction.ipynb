Using it only requires a Google account.\n",

              "'Page: Attention Is All You Need\\nSummary: \"Attention Is All You Need\" is a landmark 2017 research paper by Google. Authored by eight scientists, it was responsible for expanding 2014 attention mechanisms proposed by Bahdanau et al. into a new deep learning architecture known as the transformer. The paper is considered by some to be a founding document for modern artificial intelligence, as transformers became the main architecture of large language models. At the time, the focus of the research was on improving Seq2seq techniques for machine translation, but even in their paper the authors saw the potential for other tasks like question answering and for what is now called multimodal Generative AI.\\nThe paper\\'s title is a reference to the song \"All You Need Is Love\" by the Beatles.\\nAs of 2024, the paper has been cited more than 100,000 times.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: All You Need Is Kill\\nSummary: All You Need Is Kill is a Japanese science fiction light novel by Hiroshi Sakurazaka with illustrations by Yoshitoshi Abe. The book was published in Japanese by Shueisha under their Super Dash Bunko imprint in December 2004, and was later released in English by Viz Media under their Haikasoru imprint. All You Need Is Kill follows a soldier named Keiji Kiriya, who, after dying in a battle with extraterrestrials, is caught in a time loop that makes him live the same day repeatedly, allowing Kiriya to improve his fighting skills.\\nA manga adaptation, written by Ryōsuke Takeuchi and illustrated by Takeshi Obata, was serialized in Shueisha\\'s Weekly Young Jump magazine between January and May 2014 and was also published by Viz Media in its Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. In November 2014, the Viz translation was released in a collected edition that included the entire series. A separate graphic novel adaptation, written by Nick Mamatas and illustrated by Lee Ferguson, was released in North America in May 2014. A film adaptation from director Doug Liman starring Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt, titled Edge of Tomorrow, was released in May 2014. The English-language film tie-in edition of the novel also uses this title.\\nThe novel was Sakurazaka\\'s breakthrough science fiction novel, earning wide praise from fellow novelists including Yasutaka Tsutsui and Chōhei Kanbayashi and was entered in contention for the Best Japanese Long Work in the 36th Seiun Awards in 2005.\\n\\nPage: All You Need Is Love\\nSummary: \"All You Need Is Love\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles that was released as a non-album single in July 1967. It was written by John Lennon and credited to the Lennon–McCartney partnership. The song was Britain\\'s contribution to Our World, the first live global television link, for which the band were filmed performing it at EMI Studios in London on 25 June. The programme was broadcast via satellite and seen by an audience of over 400 million in 25 countries. Lennon\\'s lyrics were deliberately simplistic, to allow for the show\\'s international audience, and captured the utopian ideals associated with the Summer of Love. The single topped sales charts in Britain, the United States and many other countries, and became an anthem for the counterculture\\'s embrace of flower power philosophy.\\nOur World coincided with the height of the Beatles\\' popularity and influence, following the release of their album Sgt. Pepper\\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band. Rather than perform the song entirely live, the group played to a pre-recorded backing track. With an orchestral arrangement by George Martin, the song begins with a portion of the French national anthem and ends with musical quotations from works such as Glenn Miller\\'s \"In the Mood\", \"Greensleeves\", Bach\\'s Invention No. 8 in F major, and the Beatles\\' 1963 hit \"She Loves You\". Adding to the broadcast\\'s festive atmosphere, the studio was adorned with signs and streamers and filled with guests dressed in psychedelic attire, including members of the Rolling Stones, the Who and the Small Faces. Brian Epstein, the Beatles\\' manager, '"

        "There is a lot of debate around best practices for writing, documenting and formatting Python code and their actual implementation in daily practice, and many people have different personal preferences. We are not committing to a particular side in this debate, but we do care about a few general aspects:\n",
        "* working with clean code\n",
        "* working with understandable code (i.e., commented, with understandable variable names etc)\n",
        "* producing well-documented projects (e.g., supplied with relevant READMEs etc). Think: your work should be structured such that you could look at it in a year and be able to immediately what you did, how and why.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are a few de facto standard *formatting* practices that help to keep Python code crisp and clean. Please take a look at these and adhere to these as much as you can (as so will we):\n",
        "* [PEP8](https://pep8.org/): style guide for Python code defining e.g., variable naming conventions, how many spaces to use for indentation, how long single lines should be etc.\n",
        "  * Here is an overview [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4_s3q038I0) of some of the PEP8 conventions\n",
        "  * There is handy software that reformats your code for you according to some of these conventions. Such software is often seamlessly integrated in IDEs. This includes for instance *Black* or *Ruff* Python formatters. They can be installed as extensions in, e.g., Visual Studio Code.\n",
        "* *docstrings* are comments (strings) that document a specific code object and always directly follow the definition of the object (e.g., directly after `def fct(...)`). They specify the functionality, inputs, outputs and their types. Again, there are slightly different formatting styles for docstrings; please try to be consistent about your formatting.\n",
        "  * One example style of docstrings is [*numpydoc*](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard); you might see that the provided code might often use such docstrings."

        "\n",
        "One of the critical building blocks of any language model (be it an n-gram model or GPT-4) is the **training data**. The contents of the training data determine, for instance, which tokens (e.g., words) the model \"sees\" during training, how often each of them occurs, which language the model learns, but also which potential *biases* the model might inherit (more on this in lecture 9).\n",
        "\n",
        "The goals of this part of the sheet are:\n",
        "* introduce core terms and concepts that we might be using throughout the class, and that are often used in NLP papers\n",
        "* understand core data processing steps used before training LMs\n",
        "* try hands-on loading a dataset and performing basic preprocessing steps\n",

        "\n",
        "### Core concepts\n",
        "\n",
        "* **(training) data / dataset** (in the context of LMs): a collection of text data which is used as input to the LM in order to optimize its parameters, so that, ideally, the model learns to perform well on its target task; that is, to predict fluent text. Anything from a single sentence to a book can be considered data; but since learning statistics of natural language is very difficult, usually very large collections of texts (i.e., very large datasets) are used to train LMs. Generalization to other machine learning models: the type of input data might be different (e.g., images and labels for image classification models) but the purpose is the same. Data and dataset are mostly used interchangeably.\n",
        "  * **corpus** [ling.]: \"A corpus is a collection of pieces of language text in electronic form, selected according to external criteria to represent, as far as possible, a language or language variety as a source of data for linguistic research.\" [source](https://user.phil.hhu.de/~bontcheva/SS10CTCL/CTCL-IntroNotes.pdf) For the purposes of NLP, the term corpus is often used interchangeably with the term dataset, especially when referring to collections of literary texts (e.g., the Books corpus) or when sourced from corpora created in linguistics.\n",
        "    * well-known linguistic corpora are, e.g.: the [Brown corpus](http://icame.uib.no/brown/bcm.html), the British National Corpus [BNC](http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/).\n",
        "  * **test / validation data** (general ML concept): the full dataset is sually split into the *training data* (used to optimize the model), and the held-out *validation data* and *test data* (called dataset splits). Validation data is often used to optimize aspects of the model architecture (so-called hyperparameters like optimizer, drop out rate etc). This split is sometimes ommited if no hyperparameter tuning is done. Test data is then used to assess the model's performance on *unseen* data. That is, it is used to approximately answer the question: How well will my trained model perform on completely new inputs? In the context of LMs, all dataset splits are texts.\n",
        "* **cleaning & preprocessing**: this is the step when \"raw\" data (e.g., from the web) is processed so as to massage the data into a format that is optimal for the NLP task which we want to accomplish. This can include, for instance, removing markup tags, lower-casing data, splitting it into single sentences etc.\n",
        "* **annotation**: this step refers to enriching \"raw\" data with additional information like judgements about the quality of data, \"gold standard\" demonstrations of a task (e.g., gold standard answer to a question) etc, usually provided by humans. This is done generate high-quality training datasets which cannot be obtained otherwise.\n",
        "  * most prominently, human annotation is often used in the process of fine-tuning LLMs with RLHF (more on this in lecture 5).\n",
        "* **token**: minimal unit of text which is mapped onto a numerical representation to be readable for the LM. Different types of tokens have been used: single words, single characters, and recently mostly sub-word parts. Note that unique minimal units are assigned different tokens; whenever such a unit occurs in a particular context, the same numerical representation (i.e., token ID) is assigned to that unit. Therefore, the notion of a token in NLP is not completely equivalent to the notion in lingusitics (and there are no types in NLP as opposed to linguistics).  \n",
        "  * tokenization is the process of converting a string to a list or tensor of tokens.\n",
        "  * part of tokenization for training transformers is also creating *attention masks* which \"mask\" certain tokens for the model (i.e., hide it from the model during training). This is done to train models to predict next words based only on preceding context.\n",
        "  * tokenization will be discussed in more detail in the session of week 3.\n",
        "* **vocabulary**: the set of unique tokens used by a particular LM-tookenizer pair. For example, in case of the Llama-2 model, the vocabulary consists of ~32 000 tokens.\n",
        "* **embedding**: a vector representation of a single token (e.g., word2vec). These vector representations are learned in a way optimizing the next token prediction task and, intuitively, can be understood as approximating (some aspects of) the meaning of a word.\n",
        "* **batch**: a set of input sampes (i.e., texts) that is passed through the LM during training simultaneously, in parallel, during one training step, before updating the internal model parameters. The **batch size** refers to the number of input samples in the set. The batch size is a common hyperparameter of the LM architectures and might have a significant effect on set up requirements (a large batch size requires a lot of memory) and the model performance (because model parameters are updated based on the training signal from the entire batch).\n",
        "* **epoch**: an interation over the entire training dataset. Often a model is trained for several epochs, i.e., training iterates over the training set several times.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will likely extend this list and learn about more important aspects as we go on with the class, but this should already equip you with a good foundation for understanding the parts of the LM literature related to data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Main training data processing steps\n",
        "\n",
        "Before beginning to train the LM, the following steps are commonly completed:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. acquiring the training data: this step involves downloading or collecting the data of your choice onto the machine which will be used for training. Nowadays many datasets for various tasks can be downloaded from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets) or are made available in GitHub repositories.\n",
        "2. exploring and understanding the dataset: it is important to understand what kinds of texts, from which sources, on which topics, with what sentence length, ... the dataset contains. This is crucial because the model will pick up on features of the dataset in a way that might be difficult to fully anticipate (which is good if the features are, e.g., gramamticality of sentences, but bad if it is toxic language).\n",
        "3. creating the desired combination: nowadays training datasets might consist of a mix of different smaller datasets. See the exercise below for more details.\n",
        "4. cleaning: this step involves filtering out or converting non-machine readable or undesired characters, often lower-casing, removal of punctuation or digits or so-called stop-words (very common words like \"a\", \"and\"). However, the last three steps are not very common any more for state-of-the-art LLM training.\n",
        "5. splitting the dataset into train, validation, test splits\n",
        "6. prepairing the training split: training texts are often shuffled and sometimes split into shorter texts. Specifically, splitting is required if the length of a text exceeds the maximal *context window size* of the transformer model (i.e., the maximal number of tokens a model can process). In this case, texts are often split into shorter slightly overlapping chunks.\n",
        "7. tokenizing: converting the single texts into lists of tokens, i.e., into lists of numerical IDs. More on tokenization in the session of week 3.\n",
        "8. batching: to speed up training, the model is often fed multiple texts at the same time (i.e., at each training step). To create these batches, often additional steps are needed to ensure that several tokenized texts (i.e., several lists with token IDs) can be represented as one input tensor. These steps are either restricting texts to a maximal common length (and cutting off the rest) or *padding* all the texts to the same length. More on this in the tokenization session.\n",
        "\n",
        "[This article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/natural-language-processing-nlp-pipeline/) provides a great more detailed overview of the steps 1-4 and provides insights into traditional approaches (e.g., feature engineering) which are more common for task-specific models than for foundation language models."
