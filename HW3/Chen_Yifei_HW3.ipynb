    "## Exercise 1: Building a retrieval-augmented generation system (30 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "An increasingly popular approach to language generation is so called *retrieval-augmented generation* (RAG) wherein a language model is supplied with additional (textual) information retrieved from some storage, in addition to the actual task query. It has been found that this additional context improves model performance, and, e.g., allows to use LLMs with custom information (e.g., proprietary documents etc). \n",
    "\n",
    "The general set up of a RAG system is as follows:\n",
    "1. Some form of a database (DB) with (searchable) relevant background information (e.g., a database, a set of documents, ...) is created.\n",
    "   1. A common database format are *vector DBs*, or, vectore stores. You can optionally learn more about vector DBs, e.g., here: https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-database/. The important conceptual point is that some form of a searchable database with relevant (textual) information is created.\n",
    "2. An LLM that will be generating the responses to the queries, given context, is chosen.\n",
    "3. An embedding model is chosen.\n",
    "4. Task queries (e.g., questions or instructions) are provided to the system. \n",
    "   1. The query is converted to an embedding (using the model chosen ins tep 3), and the embedding is used to search and retrieve relevant information from the database. The specific retrieval method depnds on the nature of the database.\n",
    "   2. The relevant information is supplied to the LLM as context.\n",
    "5. Given the extended context, the LLM provides output.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is visualized in the figure below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](../tutorials/pics/basic_rag.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The image is sourced from [here](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/getting_started/concepts/).\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details on RAG, you can read the first part of [this](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/getting_started/concepts/) blog post (until \"important concepts within each step\"). [Here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11401) is an optional paper about RAG, in case you want to learn more. \n",
    "\n",
    "**YOUR TASK**\n",
    "> Your task in this exercise is to explore RAG by implementing a RAG system for recipe generation. The implemented RAG system should be compared to the performance of the same model in a \"vanilla\" set-up where the model solves the task directly.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> We will use the package `LlamaIndex` and the LLM `phi-3-mini-4k-instruct` model as the backbone for the implementation. We will use the `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` model as our embedding model.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> We will use unstructured data in the form of a recipe dataset `m3hrdadfi/recipe_nlg_lite`. This dataset will be indexed and it will be used to supplement information for the LLM, additionally to the query. The train split of the dataset should be used for the index, and a sample from the test dataset will be used for sampling queries with which the system will be tested. \n",
    ">\n",
    "> For this task, please complete the following steps:\n",
    "> 1. Download the dataset from Huggingface. \n",
    "> 2. Briefly familiarize yourself with the dataset.\n",
    "> 3. Briefly familiarize yourself with [this](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/getting_started/starter_example_local/) LLamaIndex example RAG system.  \n",
    "> 4. Complete the code below (in place of \"### YOUR CODE HERE ####\"), following the instructions in the comments to build a working RAG system that will generate recipes. Note that you will have to work with the LlamaIndex documentation to complete and understand the code. Some links are already provided.\n",
    "> 5. Answer the questions at the end of the exercise."

    "> 1. Inspect the results of the testing. (a) How often do you prefer the RAG response over the vanilla response? (b) Do you observe differences between the RAG and vanilla responses? If yes, what are these? (c) Inpsect the retrieved documents and their scores. Do they make sense for the queries? Do the scores match your intuition about their relevance for the query? \n",

    "**Answer**: <br>\n",
    "Advantage: Responses is more accurate and relevant <br> \n",
    "Disadvantage: require more computations and more complicated to compare\n",
    "\n",
    "> 3. What is the difference between documents and nodes in the RAG system? <br>\n",
    "**Answer**: <br>\n",
    "Documents are the raw text entries from the dataset, while nodes are the processed representations of these documents used within the vector store for efficient retrieval and similarity scoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 4. What does the embedding model do? What is the measure that underlies retrieval of relevant documents?  <br>\n",
    "**Answer**: <br>\n",
    "The embedding model converts text into dense vector representations. <br>\n",
    "Usually the measure underlying is cosine similarity or Euclidean distance between these vectors.\n",

    "> 5. What are different response modes of the query engine? Is the chosen mode a good choice for our application? Why (not)? <br>\n",
    "Different response modes include \"compact\", \"verbose\". The \"compact\" mode is a good choie for our application as it generates concise recipe instructions, avoids overwhelming users with too much information."

    "In this exercise, we want to fine-tune GPT-2 to generate human-like news summaries, following a procedure that is very similar to the example of the movie review generation from [sheet 4.1](https://cogsciprag.github.io/Understanding-LLMs-course/tutorials/04a-finetuning-RL.html). The exercise is based on the paper by [Ziegler et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08593).\n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, we will use the following components:\n",
    "* in order to initialize the policy, we use GPT-2 that was already fine-tuned for summarization, i.e., our SFT model is [this](https://huggingface.co/Ayham/albert_gpt2_Full_summarization_cnndm)\n",
    "* as our reward model, we will use a task-specific reward signal, namely, the ROUGE score that evaluates a summary generated by a model against a human \"gold standard\" summary.\n",
    "* a dataset of CNN news texts and human-written summaries (for computing the rewards) for the fine-tuning which can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/abisee/cnn_dailymail). Please note that we will use the *validation* split because we only want to run short fine-tuning. \n",

    "> 1. Please complete the code or insert comments what a particular line of code does below where the comments says \"#### YOUR CODE / COMMENT HERE ####\". For this and for answering the questions, you might need to dig a bit deeper into the working of proximal policy optimization (PPO), the algorithm that we are using for training.

Specifically, the baseline is simultaneously learned during training, and learns to predict the so-called action value, namely the expected reward for generating a particular completion, given the query. This baseline is implemented as an additional (scalar output) head next to the next-token prediction head of the policy, and is called the value head. Based on the query and completion representation, it learns to predict a scalar reward which is compared to the ground truth reward from the reward model."
